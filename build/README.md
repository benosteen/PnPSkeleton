Building the game components
============================

**PRINTGUIDE** - what needs to be printed to make a copy of the game. (eg how many copies of which files, double sided?, is there a low-ink version)

      NB it is useful to provide links in this document to download files if they prove too large for github.


**INSTRUCTIONS** - step-by-step guide to what needs to be cut out, glued to what and which parts to put on card, sleeve, etc

All other contents of this folder are for holding files for printing.

Guidelines for making printable files
-------------------------------------

* All files should have clear indications concerning the size they should be printed at. PDFs are useful for this purpose but note that not everyone has access to A4 or 8"x11" paper. Put in details about this in the PRINTGUIDE
* Everyone has their own techniques for making cards and boards, but instructions that go through basic methods (such as sleeving or simply using a large printout for the board) are recommended. Those capable of more advanced techniques can improvise given that!
* Include bleed areas once the art on a PnP has reached a level of quality where it matters. (It is still a useful concept to be aware of!) eg http://www.serviceprinters.com/help/bleed-in-printing.html
* Try to include a low-ink version where possible. Keeping prototype and mockup artwork might help here.
